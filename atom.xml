    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s time. You&rsquo;ve put in the hard work and the long hours. Deployment is all that stands between you and a real working website accessible over the internet. You push to Heroku, and you load your page. It works! Wait a minute, no, it doesn’t work. It looks like it works, but some of the features don’t operate like they did on your local machine. What’s going on? By this time, you already know the answer, but you’re dreading it so much that fanciful alternative excuses are already floating through your mind: “Heroku must not be working…Al Gore decided to break the internet…My code became self-aware and rewrote itself…” But no. JAVASCRIPT is the source of your pain, and was the source of our pain when we deployed to Heroku earlier this week.</p>

<p>So what do? First you head back to your local machine, and sure enough, all of the JavaScript features work. And then you notice it: a singular, red “!” in the console, denoting an error during resource loading.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FA75pGa.png"></p>

<p>“Error: Popover requires tooltip.js”. You receive this error on your local machine, but all of your features work, so why is this a problem? Besides, websites have errors loading resources all the time, without noticeable effect. You’re not even using anything from popover.js, or tooltip.js. Alas, Heroku does something your local machine does not: it compiles all of your application’s JavaScript into ONE file, and one broken line of code in this file can break the ENTIRE file, rendering your JavaScript useless. Now, you’re left with two options. If you’re an unlucky individual (this is the most likely scenario), your program actually is using popover.js and/or tooltip.js, and you must attack your asset pipeline without mercy, working out kinks and making sure files are explicitly loaded in a certain order to resolve dependencies. Or you can delete popover and tooltip, and redeploy to Heroku, and suddenly your app will run flawlessly. Worked for us!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Encryption keys make possible many of the most convenient aspects of the internet today. Online banking, healthcare, and investing services rely heavily on passwords to ensure the safety of our data. &ldquo;Secure&rdquo; data transfer is a bit of misnomer: it is trivial for a malicious party to gain access to data transferring across the web. Thus the need for encryption, ensuring said data can only be read by the intended recipient. Random numbers are the backbone of generating encryption keys, but there&rsquo;s one problem, humans, and computers, are TERRIBLE at generating passwords and random numbers, respectively. Computer programs follow pre-written instructions, and it is therefore impossible for them to generate truly random numbers. So what happens when we type rand into our Ruby programs? A pseudo-random number generator is used; in ruby&rsquo;s case, a Mersenne Twister. By far the most common PRNG, the Mersenne Twister is unfortunately not robust enough for use in cryptography, as observing relatively few cycles enables the prediction of future output.</p>

<p>So what do? Enter the HARDWARE random number generator:</p>

<p><img src="http://onerng.info/img/BoardAndTinfoilHat.png"></p>

<p>OneRNG provides a simple open source method for generating random numbers, relying on entropy from an avalanche diode circuit (your guess is as good as mine) and an RF receiver that channel hops among radio waves. Now, this does not provide true randomness, but is much better than Ruby&rsquo;s Random.</p>

<p>You be asking, why mess with these imperfect solutions, surely there must be a way to generate a real random number for Pete&rsquo;s sake!  Take a look:</p>

<p>Radioactive particles decay stochastically, preventing an observer from predicting future decay. Be sure to use a Geiger counter if you go this route.</p>

    <id>http://mhfairbank.github.io/blog/2014/10/09/mesh</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In order to prevent myself from relying on the .each method whenever an iteration is necessary, I&rsquo;ve decided to take a closer look at methods that help reduce the need for multiple layers of nesting within my code. The .map (aka .collect) and .select methods drew my attention first. When called on an object, .map will iterate through the object, and return the evaluation of the accompanying code block into a new array.</p>

<p>map.rb file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">orig_array</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;alo&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ha&quot;</span><span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">orig_array</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">map</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">string</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">string</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ha&quot;</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And when we run map.rb:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>ruby map.rb
</span><span class='line'>aloha
</span><span class='line'>haha
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The code block concatenated an additional &ldquo;ha&rdquo; onto both strings in the original array, and populated a new array with the new strings.</p>

<p>The .select method allows us to evaluate a block of code for each element in the original array, and if the evaluation returns true, the method will populate a new array with the original value from the array upon which .select was called.</p>

<p>select.rb file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">orig_array</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;some&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;of&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;these&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;words&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;have&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;four&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;letters&quot;</span><span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">orig_array</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">select</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">string</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">string</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">size</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And when we run select.rb:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span>16:20:26<span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nb">source</span><span class="o">)</span> code
</span><span class='line'>♥ ruby <span class="k">select</span>.rb
</span><span class='line'>some
</span><span class='line'>have
</span><span class='line'>four
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The code block evaluates whether the string has four characters, and the .select method populates a new array with the original items whenever the code block evaluation returns true.</p>

<p>Finally I&rsquo;d like to touch on an emerging technology in the web/tech sphere: mesh networks.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/C1yubIf.jpg"></p>

<p> As this NPR article (<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/09/29/352476454/how-hong-kong-protesters-are-connecting-without-cell-or-wi-fi-networks">http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/09/29/352476454/how-hong-kong-protesters-are-connecting-without-cell-or-wi-fi-networks</a>) documents, protestors in Hong Kong have faced a shutdown of their internet service accessed from their phones, leaving them unable to effectively organize themselves. Enter Firechat, a new app that&rsquo;s been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times in Hong Kong over the last few weeks. Firechat enables phones to communicate directly with any other phones within wifi range. By linking these connections together into a mesh network, the protestors are able to communicate over the network, sans internet access. And, if at least one of the nodes in the network is connected to the internet, the other phones can access it by hopping from phone to phone until they reach the internet-connected node. The technology is still primitive: Firechat doesn&rsquo;t even implement encryption, so anyone on the network can sniff the data their node relays. But it&rsquo;s a start, and may well signal a future of the internet that does not have the functionality of &ldquo;turning off&rdquo;, as it does today with much more centralized access nodes.</p>
